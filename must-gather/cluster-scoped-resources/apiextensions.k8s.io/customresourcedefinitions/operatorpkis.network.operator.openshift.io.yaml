          - the CA certificate\n\n\n- A ConfigMap called <name>-ca with a single data
          key:\n  - cabundle.crt - the CA certificate(s)\n\n\n- A Secret called <name>-cert
          with two data keys:\n  - tls.key - the private key\n  - tls.crt - the certificate,
          signed by the CA\n\n\nThe CA certificate will have a validity of 10 years,
          rotated after 9.\nThe target certificate will have a validity of 6 months,
          rotated after 3\n\n\nThe CA certificate will have a CommonName of \"<namespace>_<name>-ca@<timestamp>\",
